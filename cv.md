## 🐱 **About myself**
I don't have a technology-related degree and don’t know any programming languages. I’m passionate about journalism, but now I’m looking into possibilities for a new profession change. Web Development is an excellent career choice, in my view. This sphere offers quick employment, opportunities in every sector, multiple career paths and endless possibilities for professional growth.
I’m best at learning new skills that will improve my life — both personally and professionally. Now I want to focus on my studies at RS School.
